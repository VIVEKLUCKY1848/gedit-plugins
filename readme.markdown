# gedit plugins

To use these plugins, put all the files into `~/.gnome2/gedit/plugins`
(you should create it if it doesn't already exist)

## trailsave

Originally by [Osmo Salomaa](http://users.tkk.fi/~otsaloma/gedit/).
I have modified it to leave whitespace-only lines alone, which
includes blank lines at the end of documents.

## copy-document-location

Based on [Osmo Salomaa's "open-terminal-here" plugin](http://users.tkk.fi/~otsaloma/gedit/),
this plugin puts the full path to the current document into the gnome clipboard.
