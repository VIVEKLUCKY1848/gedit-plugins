# gedit plugins

To use a plugin, put each of its files into `~/.gnome2/gedit/plugins` -
you should create this folder if it doesn't already exist.

## trailsave

Originally by [Osmo Salomaa](http://users.tkk.fi/~otsaloma/gedit/).
I have modified it to leave whitespace-only lines alone, which
includes blank lines at the end of documents.

## copy-document-location

Based on [Osmo Salomaa's "open-terminal-here" plugin](http://users.tkk.fi/~otsaloma/gedit/),
this plugin puts the full path to the current document into the gnome clipboard.
